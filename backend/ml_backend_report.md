## 3. Model Evaluation Framework

### 3.1 Discrimination Metrics

**Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC)**

- **Definition**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes across all classification thresholds
- **Interpretation**: Values range from 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect)
- **Clinical Significance**: Higher values indicate better diagnostic accuracy

**Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)**

- **Definition**: Evaluates precision-recall trade-off, particularly valuable for imbalanced datasets
- **Interpretation**: More informative than AUROC when positive class is rare
- **Clinical Application**: Critical for medical diagnosis where false negatives are costly

### 3.2 Calibration Metrics

**Brier Score Loss**

- **Definition**: Mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes
- **Formula**: BS = (1/N) × Σ(pᵢ - oᵢ)²
- **Interpretation**: Lower values indicate better calibration (optimal = 0)
- **Clinical Relevance**: Ensures predicted probabilities reflect true likelihood of disease

**Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**

- **Definition**: Average absolute difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy across probability bins
- **Calculation**: Divides predictions into 10 equal-width bins, computes weighted average of bin-wise calibration errors
- **Interpretation**: Lower ECE indicates more reliable probability estimates
- **Threshold**: ECE < 0.1 generally considered well-calibrated

### 3.3 Calibration Plot Analysis

#### Heart Disease Model Calibration Plot

![Heart Disease Calibration Plot](./calibration_plot.png)
*Figure 1: Heart Disease Model Calibration Plot showing predicted vs actual probabilities*

**Technical Analysis:**
The calibration plot reveals significant calibration issues in the heart disease model:

- **Overconfidence in Low-Risk Predictions**: Model predictions near 0.1-0.2 show actual positive rates of 0.0, indicating overconfident negative predictions
- **Extreme Volatility**: Sharp fluctuations between bins suggest unstable probability estimates
- **Poor Reliability**: Significant deviations from the diagonal indicate unreliable probability outputs
- **Clinical Impact**: Patients may receive misleading risk assessments

**How to Read This Graph:**

- **X-axis (Mean Predicted Probability)**: The average probability predicted by the model for each bin
- **Y-axis (Fraction of Positives)**: The actual proportion of positive cases in each bin
- **Diagonal Dashed Line**: Represents perfect calibration where predicted = actual probabilities
- **Orange Line with Markers**: Shows actual model performance across probability bins
- **Interpretation**: Points closer to the diagonal indicate better calibration

**Clinical Implications:**
The erratic pattern suggests the model's probability outputs cannot be trusted for clinical decision-making without recalibration.

#### Diabetes Model Calibration Plot

![Diabetes Model Calibration Plot](./diabetes_calibration_plot.png)
*Figure 2: Diabetes Model Calibration Plot demonstrating excellent calibration performance*

**Technical Analysis:**

- **Near-Perfect Alignment**: Orange line closely follows the diagonal reference
- **Consistent Reliability**: Predicted probabilities accurately reflect true positive rates
- **Clinical Trustworthiness**: Healthcare providers can confidently use probability outputs for decision-making
- **Smooth Progression**: Gradual increase without erratic fluctuations

**How to Read This Graph:**

- **Perfect Calibration Indicator**: The orange line's proximity to the diagonal shows excellent calibration
- **Smooth Curve**: Indicates stable probability estimates across all risk levels
- **Clinical Utility**: Probability outputs can be directly used for patient counseling and treatment decisions

**Clinical Implications:**
This model provides reliable probability estimates that accurately reflect true diabetes risk, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

### 3.4 Fairness Analysis

**Demographic Parity Difference**

- **Definition**: Absolute difference in positive prediction rates between demographic groups
- **Formula**: |P(Ŷ=1|A=0) - P(Ŷ=1|A=1)|
- **Fairness Threshold**: Values < 0.1 indicate reasonable demographic parity

**Equalized Odds**

- **True Positive Rate Difference**: |TPR_group1 - TPR_group2|
- **False Positive Rate Difference**: |FPR_group1 - FPR_group2|
- **Interpretation**: Lower differences indicate more equitable treatment across groups
- **Clinical Ethics**: Ensures equal diagnostic accuracy regardless of protected attributes
