Prana Pulse: AI-Powered Preventive Health Assessment
Prana Pulse is a modern, AI-driven web application designed to predict an individual's risk of chronic lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. By collecting self-reported health data, the application provides an instant risk score and generates personalized, evidence-backed preventive recommendations using AI.

This project was built for a hackathon focused on leveraging AI for early disease risk prediction, aiming to bridge the gap in preventive healthcare caused by cost, access, and awareness.
